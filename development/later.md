This stuff may be implemented later after the main plan.md

Silence Skipping
- silence skipping threshold confugration
- userreport button and count in db on whether threshold is too high or too low (skips non-silence or doesn't skip silence), can vote and stuff
- address stuff like student questions being quieter than main speaker, maybe local thresholding or something

- make polling work (claude could not do it for me)


Sponsorblock
sponsorblock maybe drag and drop categories None | Show button | Auto Skip
sponsorblock highlight integration
chapters feature (yt + sponsorblock)? (already have youtube chapters in-player for many videos)
